> *"A crude CRUD"*

A quick, small assignment leveraging:
* __Ionic 4__ 
* __Angular__
* __Firebase__
  * User Authentication
  * Firestore
  * Cloud Storage

Underlying idea was to create an app that would allow users to store their receipts (including basic description), and in process get to know a bit of <br> non-native mobile development.
As expected, most of the difficulty came from Ionic, Typescript & Node.js, and their notorious version issues.
